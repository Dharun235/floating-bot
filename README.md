## Troubleshooting

### Ollama Connection Issues

If you see "Error connecting to Ollama":

1. Make sure Ollama is installed and running: `ollama serve`
2. Check that the Ollama API is accessible at `http://localhost:11434`
3. Verify your model is installed: `ollama list`

### Microphone Issues

If the microphone button doesn't work:

1. Make sure you have a working microphone connected
2. Check microphone permissions for your terminal/application
3. On Linux, ensure you have PulseAudio or ALSA properly configured
4. Try running: `python -m speech_recognition` to test your setup

### Model Not Found

If you see "Model not found" error:

```bash
# Pull the model first
ollama pull phi3:mini

# Or use a different model you have installed
ollama list  # See available models
```

### PyAudio Installation Issues

If PyAudio installation fails, better use conda environment.

## Privacy & Data

- ✅ **All conversations happen locally** - no data is sent to external servers
- ✅ **Voice recognition requires internet** - Google Speech API is used for speech-to-text
- ✅ **AI processing is offline** - Ollama runs completely on your machine
- ✅ **No data collection** - this app doesn't collect or store any personal data

**Note**: If you need completely offline voice recognition, you can modify the code to use offline alternatives like Vosk or Whisper.
